Welcome to the Random Number Guesser Game! 
You may view this as a waste of time (as the 
probability of you guessing any number correct 
is really low), it's a project I wanted to 
work on to test my MATLAB skills! 
So without further ado, allow me to 
guide you through the very simple... 
... and brutal... Random Number Guesser Game! 

Choosing Difficulty: 
There are three base difficulties the game has: 
Easy, where the random number is between 0 and 10 
Medium, where the random number is between 0 and 100 
Hard, where the random number is between 0 and 1000 
The game is case sensitive, ensure to type "Easy" 
and not "easy" or anything else for that matter.

Guess the Number: 
After the difficulty has been chosen, you will have
three, and only three guesses to check for the correct answer. 
You'll quickly learn the consequences of getting 
a correct, incorrect, or invalid value.

Replay: 
After winning or losing (most likely losing), 
you will be asked whether or not you'd like to 
try again. This will require a new difficulty 
and a new number. You only get three chances!
Be sure to play them wisely!
If you choose No, since you're likely a loser, 
you'll simply be returned back to the main menu. 

Now, no more questions! It's time to put on your
thinking caps and start guessing random numbers!
